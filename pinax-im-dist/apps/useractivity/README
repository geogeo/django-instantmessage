useractivity
============

This small app allows you to get a list of online users. This is accomplished, 
by introducing useractivity.middleware.UserActivityMiddleware, which periodically
captures user's ip address, and dumps it to the database along with the current 
timestamp. The period is defined by ACTIVITY_UPDATE_DELAY option, which equals
to the number of seconds before the next snapshot is taken.

User activity data in the database is then processed by celery.PeriodicTask,
which populates the rabbitmq exchange, allowing to get a list of user data 
dicts without hitting the database. User data dicts are filled from User models, 
accoring to the list of attributes, which by default equals to ["username"]. You 
can override this behaviour by setting ACTIVITIY_USER_DATA option.
