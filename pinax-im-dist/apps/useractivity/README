useractivity
============

This small app allows you to get a list of online users. This is accomplished, 
by introducing useractivity.middleware.UserActivityMiddleware, which periodically
captures user's ip address, and dumps it to the database along with the current 
timestamp. The period is defined by ACTIVITY_UPDATE_DELAY (default 60s) option, 
which equals to the number of seconds before the next snapshot is taken.

Activity data is then made availible through useractivity.context_processors.users_online
context processor, which populates ONLINE_USERS context variable with a list of 
users, active within the last ACTIVITY_UPDATE_DELAY seconds. Obviously, we don't need
to update this variable each time, as user activity itself is updated periodically.
Thus, the value is cached with a timeout equal to the set up delay value.

Note: you can also get activity data with a utility function get_online_users().


Installation:
-------------

1. List this application with required apps in the INSTALLED_APPS portion of 
   your settings file. Your settings file might look something like:
   
       INSTALLED_APPS = (
           # ...
           "useractivity",
       )

2. Install activity tracking middleware. Your settings file might look something
   like:
   
       MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
           # ...
           "useractivity.middleware.UserActivityMiddleware",
       )

3. Install online users context processor. Your settings file might look something
   like:

        TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = (
            # ...
            "useractivity.context_processors.online_users",
        )

Done! Now you have a list of online users (as User instances) in your template
context, stored in the ONLINE_USERS variable, and availible through get_online_users
function.


Optional Settings:
------------------

There's no required settings in useractivity, but there's one optional setting,
which modifies the interval between useractivity snapshots. This settings is
USERACTIVITY_UPDATE_DELAY, change it, if the default value (60 seconds) doesn't 
fit your needs.
