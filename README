django-instantmessage
---------------------

IM-like application for Pinax social networks (Django), that allow you
to see which friends are online and chat them

    http://metaoptimize.com/projects/django-instantmessage

Please refer to the README files in
    pinax-im-dist/apps/im/
and
    pinax-im-dist/apps/useractivity/

Note that this code distribution is designed for Pinax social networks
(http://pinaxproject.com/). It might be possible to take the two
applications (pinax-im-dist/apps/im and pinax-im-dist/apps/useractivity),
and separate them into separate distributions, for use with generic
Django sites, not just Pinax ones. I am not experienced with Django
packaging, and I encourage other users to experiment with using this
code for non-Pinax Django site, and re-releasing it.
