django-instantmessage
---------------------

IM-like application for Pinax social networks (Django), that allow you
to see which friends are online and chat them

    http://metaoptimize.com/projects/django-instantmessage

Please refer to the README files in
    pinax-im-dist/apps/im/
and
    pinax-im-dist/apps/useractivity/

Note that this code distribution is designed for Pinax social networks
(http://pinaxproject.com/). It might be possible to take the two
applications (pinax-im-dist/apps/im and pinax-im-dist/apps/useractivity),
and separate them into separate distributions, for use with generic
Django sites, not just Pinax ones. I am not experienced with Django
packaging, and I encourage other users to experiment with using this
code for non-Pinax Django site, and re-releasing it.

This code was written by Sergei Lebedev
(http://www.rentacoder.com/RentACoder/DotNet/SoftwareCoders/ShowBioInfo.aspx?lngAuthorId=7183794),

HISTORICAL NOTE:
    If you look at this git revision:
        http://github.com/turian/django-instantmessage/commit/d8d7961a54040f1562c136ebd63ef037d371ac13
    you will see the last version of the code before we started using
    the database in the applications.

    It used to be the case that, to avoid hitting the database
    often, the original version of this code used Celery
    (http://www.celeryproject.org/), a distributed queue that sits on
    the RabbitMQ AMQP messager broker (http://www.rabbitmq.com/).

    However, it was to tricky to find bugs in the application, and seemed
    like an instance of premature optimization. So, the current version
    of the code uses the database in both apps.
